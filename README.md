# Deep Learning - Convolution Neural Networks 
Study and Reflect on the research related to use of deep learning models in human action recognition

## Details
A theoretical project to study  the previously published research that proposes the application of 3D Convolutional Neural Network to address the problem of human action recognition . The paper proposes the use of deep learning models, specifically extending by 2D CNN to 3D CNN, in challenging areas of computer vision using the airport surveillance dataset as context . This project reflects on key areas of the chosen research paper like how 3D CNN can be used to extract more contagious information in comparison to the 2D CNN in motion datasets, potential challenges that can be faced while implementing it  in real word and various legal and ethical considerations.
